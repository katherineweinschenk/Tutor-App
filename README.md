# Tutor-App

This Django web app was created in CS 3240 (Advanced Software Development Methods) at the University of Virginia.
It was coded in collaboration with Carter Cundiff, Julie Weiss, and Joe Sanders. The app represents a culmination of learning, 
demonstrating our ability to learn Django, Html, CSS, Bootstrap, and Postgres in one semester. The compiled version is available 
at https://project-102-supertuber.herokuapp.com/

Within the app, we have implemented messaging and location services to connect students and tutors such that it is easy and accessible to connect with scholars in the area.
